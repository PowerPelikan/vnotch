    m_Localized: With the controls covered, let's take a look at the heart of this
      experiment. The impact test machine.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1396359933952
    m_Localized: We will go over its basic components and how to use it.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 2506327961600
    m_Localized: 'In order to use the hammer, we first need to pull up the swinging
      part.

      This is done with the crank, which controls a tugging arm.'
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 3594464636928
    m_Localized: Rotate the crank to bring the tugging arm into position
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 3811914133504
    m_Localized: Alright!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 5308311777280
    m_Localized: "Next, we need to attach the tugging arm such that it actually pulls
      up the hammer. \nThis is done via this highlighted part. Attach it now"
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 5738295046144
    m_Localized: Great!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 352298484740096
    m_Localized: Now, we can pull up the tugging arm again, bringing the hammer into
      a position from which we can drop it
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 352455070691328
    m_Localized: Good job!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 352554496667648
    m_Localized: Now that the hammer is in position, let's look at how to insert
      a sample.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 352827512303616
    m_Localized: There is a prepared sample for you to use on the table. Go pick
      it up now!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 352994613374976
    m_Localized: Alright!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 353347035574272
    m_Localized: To place this sample, we first need to open the hatch of the machine
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 353479030321152
    m_Localized: Now, let's place the sample inside the machine.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 353625323450368
    m_Localized: Finally, we need to center the sample using this little lever
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 353766868627456
    m_Localized: Alright. The sample has been correctly inserted, so we can close
      the hatch for now.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 353907189067776
    m_Localized: Okay!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 353977120698368
    m_Localized: Now, before you detach the hammer, sending it swinging, we need
      to ensure we are getting proper measurements
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 354278150090752
    m_Localized: This is done by resetting the dial of the machine. Let's have a
      closer look
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 354526171869184
    m_Localized: To reset the dial, we need to push in the little knob, letting us
      push around the hand of the dial
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 354724780552192
    m_Localized: Okay, we are finished here. Let's get back to the machine proper.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 354760801234944
    m_Localized: Yes!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 354965554573312
    m_Localized: Now that the sample has been inserted and measurements prepared,
      we can let the hammer drop down.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 355241971789824
    m_Localized: To do that, we simply detach the hammer from the tugging arm that
      is currently holding it up.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 355380094414848
    m_Localized: That's it!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 355436952399872
    m_Localized: Now, there is two main types of information we can derive here.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 355610651111424
    m_Localized: First, the imact work the machine has measured as it hit the sample
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 355731807776768
    m_Localized: Secondly, we can look at the broken sample to determine its relative
      brittleness
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 356048150573056
    m_Localized: TODO
