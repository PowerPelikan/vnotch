    m_Localized: 'The Charpy impact test is a widely employed method for assessing
      the toughness or impact work of materials. It measures the ability of a material
      to absorb energy and resist fracture when subjected to a sudden impact load.

      This
      application simulates this experiment, modelling the steps required to operate
      a impact test machine - as well as a method to note down results.'
